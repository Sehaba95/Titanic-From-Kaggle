<h1>Titanic from Kaggle</h1>
In this project I've applied a different classifiers to Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset contain 891 samples for train the model, 418 samples for test and has 13 features (5 of them are selected for the classification).

The file "train.csv" contain data (Features and Targets) for train the model. The file "test.csv" contain features for the model test. The file "gender_submission.csv" contain targets for test the model.

<h2>Features selected are:</h2>

	Pclass : A proxy for socio-economic status (1st = Upper, 2nd = Middle, 3rd = Lower)
	Age : Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
	SibSp : The dataset defines family relations in this way: 
			Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
			Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
	Parch : The dataset defines family relations in this way...
			Parent = mother, father
			Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
			Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
	Sex
